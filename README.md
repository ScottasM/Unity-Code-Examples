# Unity-Code-Examples

In this repository I will keep smaller code examples. Since most of my work belongs to clients, I can't really share whole projects without their permission, but some parts of the code I did manage to get the permission.

Larger examples can be seen in : [Multiplatform sign in](https://github.com/ScottasM/Unity-multiplatform-sign-in-GPGS-Apple) and [UI animation](https://github.com/ScottasM/Simple-unity-UI-animation)

# [Tile grid](https://github.com/ScottasM/Unity-Code-Examples/tree/main/TileGrid)
This allows you to turn your 2d map into a grid and place tiles (squares) predefined in a scriptable object into the grid.

# [Model Rotation](https://github.com/ScottasM/Unity-Code-Examples/blob/main/ModelRotation/ModelRotation.cs)
This script allows you to rotate 3d objects by dragging your mouse/finger over it.
